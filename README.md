In this task i used MVC Design Pattern for some reasons 

1- Very simple design and  adaptable

2-  The Task doesn't have a heavy business logic to separate it from View Controller 

3-  Task don't need to make UnitTest 

4- One of the reasons why i use MVC is that very easy and fast to design simple applications but when we use it to design a huge application we get MVC refers to (Massive View Controller) 


Thanks,
